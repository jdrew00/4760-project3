Description: Program demonstrates IPC through shared memory and Semaphores

How to run program:
./master  [-t ss n] [-h]

ss the maximum time in seconds (default 100 seconds) after which the process should terminate itself if not completed
n number of slave processes to execute
If n is over 18 it will be set to 18 for safety

The ss arg is not optional. It must be ran with
./master -t ss n
with ss and n being supplied.

I suggest testing it with 
./master -t 1000 6

The program takes several minutes. Testing it with this small number of proccesses shows the bakery algorithm working properly.

Running this command in the shell will remove the log files
find ./ -name "logfile.*" | xargs rm -r

Running this command in the shell will remove ctest:
rm ctest
